        <b>Submitting Digital Material:</b>
        The AAPB also welcomes pre-digitized and born-digital programming. Again, submitting your materials to the AAPB means they become even more discoverable and accessible to researchers, the public, and archival producers interested in licensing your content. They will also be preserved at the Library of Congress. To submit your digital programming, simply follow steps 1 - 3 above, then ship your materials to us on a hard drive. We can also explore transferring them through cloud-sharing services

      <h3>Learn More About the AAPB and the Digital Preservation Project</h3>
      <div>
        In 2007, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting launched an initiative to develop a digital public broadcasting archive. The Library of Congress and GBH took over stewardship of the American Archive of Public Broadcasting in 2013 with the goal to preserve and make accessible significant historical content created by public media, and to coordinate a national effort to save at-risk public media before its content is lost to posterity. Since 2013, the AAPB has archived more than 190,000 items from more than 550 stations and producers.
